### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Eugene, software engineer from Germany.

After some tutorials or books many of us have a feeling, that they understand everything and can change the world. 
Then we try to program something and the real world is seems much more complicated.  
Here I want to collect my programming experience and share my commits with you! â€¨
ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on my most important project - myself ðŸ˜„ Iâ€™m trying to create my own web blog based on micro service architecture using Java (Spring) and TS (Vue)
